Farmers curse the creatures for sucking their livestock dry. It is from such beleaguered people that the bloodseeker's regional name \"stirge\", possibly a corruption of the word \"scourge\", comes. Folk wisdom holds that the appearance of bloodseekers in a region signals a healthy herd of livestock, but more often it means bogs or old buildings that haven't been properly tended to. Certainly, no amount of folksy parable can assuage a farmer driven to destitution by a bloodseeker infestation. But despite their role as parasites, bloodseekers aren't hated by all villages. In some cases, the inhabitants of remote backwoods thorps even keep the things as pets or use them as doubtful medicinal \"tools\" to drain away unwanted humors or test for evil spirits possessing the blood. Worshippers of gods of pestilence and parasites often view bloodseekers as sacred to their faith and allow the creatures to feed freely from their bodies. In such societies, those who accidentally give too much are considered to have been \"blessed\" by the village's hungry god.</p>\n<p>Bloodseekers seem to be constantly hungry, but they are not inherently malevolent. They can be scared away fairly easily and prefer to swiftly retreat rather than risk death. Some adventurers report that these creatures can be scared away by waving torches at the flying pests. However, bloodseekers are much bolder when encountered in larger numbers, as bringing down one victim lets an entire colony feed. Bloodseeker colonies are called clots, for obvious and disgusting reasons. If a lone bloodseeker finds a likely victim while its clot is nearby, it emits a high-pitched, keening noise to summon reinforcements.</p>\n<p>Most humanoids avoid bloodseekers, but boggards sometimes cultivate bloodseeker nests around the perimeter of their territory. These colonies serve as a deterrent to intruders, and the boggards sometimes check for bloodseeker prey, collecting the hides or bodies of animals killed by the pests. Meals prepared from slain bloodseekers that have gorged on the blood of specific creatures are a staple among certain boggard communities. The boggards not only eat the actual bloodseekers, but they also make a gelled slurry from the drained blood.</p>\n<p>A typical bloodseeker is about a foot long, with mottled, reddish-brown skin and a yellow underbelly. Its four wings resemble bat wings. When gorged with blood, the creature becomes bloated and pink, and it tends to wobble unsteadily in the air as it flies off to digest its meal.","source":{"value":"Pathfinder Society Intro: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries"}},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":7},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":6}},"traits":{"attitude":{"value":"hostile"},"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dr":[],"dv":[],"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":[]},"rarity":{"value":"uncommon"},"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 60 feet"},"size":{"value":"tiny"},"traits":{"custom":"","value":["animal","shadow"]}},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.pfs-season-3-bestiary.9auIrnhXBCHnO5Ww"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"a9nhBEqNFJ9N1rH5","data":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":["attach"]},"bonus":{"value":9},"damageRolls":{},"description":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":["finesse"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/mystery-man.svg","name":"Barbed Leg","sort":100000,"type":"melee"},{"_id":"oQxGeLSQxmxGUQ1l","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"interaction"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.Darkvision]</p>"},"requirements":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":"darkvision","source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":[]},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.qCCLZhnp2HhP3Ex6"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Darkvision","sort":200000,"type":"action"},{"_id":"yLq2DsGvZs0Z0aZN","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"interaction"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.Scent]</p>"},"requirements":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":"scent","source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":[]},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.rqfnQ5VHT5hxm25r"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Scent (Imprecise) 60 feet","sort":300000,"type":"action"},{"_id":"JVIBnOUuWnNu8a5N","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"defensive"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>Coated in darkness, a shrouded bloodseeker is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} in bright light as if it were in dim light, even to creatures that can see clearly in those light levels.</p>"},"requirements":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":[]},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Umbral Shroud","sort":400000,"type":"action"},{"_id":"QEvRlTqwOEac04ov","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"offensive"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>When a bloodseeker hits a target larger than itself, its barbed legs attach it to that creature.

Grindylows generally organize into schools ranging from a few individuals to a few hundred.

They often lair in mobile shelters, such as a sargasso of seaweed or the hull of an abandoned ship. They are skilled scavengers and hunters that eat anything they can sink their teeth into.</p>\n<p>Grindylows respect the power of bigger sea predators but have a special hatred for squids (or anything they believe looks like a squid). Sailors plying grindylow-infested waters often paint the images of squids on the bottoms of their hulls in hopes of warding the little terrors off. While this can keep smaller schools at bay, it can also backfire, potentially inciting larger groups to gather for a coordinated attack; this becomes especially more likely if the ship's route becomes predictable.

Farmers curse the creatures for sucking their livestock dry. It is from such beleaguered people that the bloodseeker's regional name \"stirge\", possibly a corruption of the word \"scourge\", comes. Folk wisdom holds that the appearance of bloodseekers in a region signals a healthy herd of livestock, but more often it means bogs or old buildings that haven't been properly tended to. Certainly, no amount of folksy parable can assuage a farmer driven to destitution by a bloodseeker infestation. But despite their role as parasites, bloodseekers aren't hated by all villages. In some cases, the inhabitants of remote backwoods thorps even keep the things as pets or use them as doubtful medicinal \"tools\" to drain away unwanted humors or test for evil spirits possessing the blood. Worshippers of gods of pestilence and parasites often view bloodseekers as sacred to their faith and allow the creatures to feed freely from their bodies. In such societies, those who accidentally give too much are considered to have been \"blessed\" by the village's hungry god.</p>\n<p>Bloodseekers seem to be constantly hungry, but they are not inherently malevolent. They can be scared away fairly easily and prefer to swiftly retreat rather than risk death. Some adventurers report that these creatures can be scared away by waving torches at the flying pests. However, bloodseekers are much bolder when encountered in larger numbers, as bringing down one victim lets an entire colony feed. Bloodseeker colonies are called clots, for obvious and disgusting reasons. If a lone bloodseeker finds a likely victim while its clot is nearby, it emits a high-pitched, keening noise to summon reinforcements.</p>\n<p>Most humanoids avoid bloodseekers, but boggards sometimes cultivate bloodseeker nests around the perimeter of their territory. These colonies serve as a deterrent to intruders, and the boggards sometimes check for bloodseeker prey, collecting the hides or bodies of animals killed by the pests. Meals prepared from slain bloodseekers that have gorged on the blood of specific creatures are a staple among certain boggard communities.

No longer human at all, these people, who call themselves kayals, have become monochromatic in coloration, with flesh tones and hair colors varying between white, black, and all shades of gray. Their limbs are lithe and willowy, and their eyes are generally solid yellow, yellow-green, or white, though a rare few have a purple or blue glow.</p>\n<p>Fetchlings have developed their own complex societies in the Shadow Plane, often under the tolerance of or in servitude to the strange, malignant creatures there, such as the sinister velstracs or the enigmatic d'ziriaks. While individual fetchlings can be any alignment, they are all survivors in a harsh environment, which leads to a tendency toward pragmatism. Fetchling clothing mimics the regions they dwell in, with drab colors tending toward darker shades. When they trade with humans or other societies on the Material Plane, they often wear masks or concealing clothing to hide their appearance.</p>\n<p>Typical fetchling communities are insular and swiftly close ranks in the event of an intruder. Though individual fetchlings don't mind traveling to and blending in with other societies to facilitate trade, they often hide or even react defensively if they have their own visitors. When one considers the nature of the other denizens of the Shadow Plane, however, this tendency to assume the worst of interlopers might make sense to some.</p>\n<p>Fetchlings are not as common on the Material Plane; most of those who dwell there are loners by choice who have left their home to seek out adventure elsewhere, exiles who were banished from their homelands, or planar castaways with no ability to return to the Shadow Plane. This last category, the lost and stranded, are the most likely to be found in larger groups. In cities of significant size, one can sometimes even find a small community of a few dozen or more fetchlings living among humans, although they often do so subtly by dyeing their hair, wearing brightly colored clothing, and utilizing layers of makeup to hide their pallid complexions.</p>\n<p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder Society Intro: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":5},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":9},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":5}},"traits":{"attitude":{"value":"hostile"},"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dr":[],"dv":[],"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["common","shadowtongue"]},"rarity":{"value":"uncommon"},"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"size":{"value":"med"},"traits":{"custom":"","value":["fetchling","humanoid","shadow"]}},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.pfs-season-3-bestiary.nS4auasfEXEU0rtx"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"LRu9rZ2D08Nr5Wa4","data":{"ability":{"value":"cha"},"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"displayLevel":{},"displayLevels":{},"item":{"value":0},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":true},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":false},"signatureSpells":{"value":[]},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot1":{"max":1,"prepared":[],"value":1},"slot10":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot11":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot2":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot3":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot4":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot5":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot6":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot7":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot8":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot9":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0}},"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"spelldc":{"dc":15,"item":0,"mod":0,"value":7},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":[]},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/mystery-man.svg","name":"Occult Innate Spells","sort":100000,"type":"spellcastingEntry"},{"_id":"TNfduKabCjNGvHGp","data":{"ability":{"value":""},"area":{"areaType":"","value":null},"areasize":{"value":""},"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"category":{"value":"spell"},"components":{"focus":false,"material":false,"somatic":true,"verbal":true},"cost":{"value":""},"damage":{"value":{}},"description":{"value":"<p>You create an illusion that causes you to appear as another creature of the same body shape, and with roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and weight (within 50 pounds), as yourself.

No longer human at all, these people, who call themselves kayals, have become monochromatic in coloration, with flesh tones and hair colors varying between white, black, and all shades of gray. Their limbs are lithe and willowy, and their eyes are generally solid yellow, yellow-green, or white, though a rare few have a purple or blue glow.</p>\n<p>Fetchlings have developed their own complex societies in the Shadow Plane, often under the tolerance of or in servitude to the strange, malignant creatures there, such as the sinister velstracs or the enigmatic d'ziriaks. While individual fetchlings can be any alignment, they are all survivors in a harsh environment, which leads to a tendency toward pragmatism. Fetchling clothing mimics the regions they dwell in, with drab colors tending toward darker shades. When they trade with humans or other societies on the Material Plane, they often wear masks or concealing clothing to hide their appearance.</p>\n<p>Typical fetchling communities are insular and swiftly close ranks in the event of an intruder. Though individual fetchlings don't mind traveling to and blending in with other societies to facilitate trade, they often hide or even react defensively if they have their own visitors. When one considers the nature of the other denizens of the Shadow Plane, however, this tendency to assume the worst of interlopers might make sense to some.</p>\n<p>Fetchlings are not as common on the Material Plane; most of those who dwell there are loners by choice who have left their home to seek out adventure elsewhere, exiles who were banished from their homelands, or planar castaways with no ability to return to the Shadow Plane. This last category, the lost and stranded, are the most likely to be found in larger groups. In cities of significant size, one can sometimes even find a small community of a few dozen or more fetchlings living among humans, although they often do so subtly by dyeing their hair, wearing brightly colored clothing, and utilizing layers of makeup to hide their pallid complexions.</p>\n<p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder Society Intro: Year of Shattered Sanctuaries"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":7},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":11},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":7}},"traits":{"attitude":{"value":"hostile"},"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":[]},"dr":[],"dv":[],"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["common","shadowtongue"]},"rarity":{"value":"uncommon"},"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"size":{"value":"med"},"traits":{"custom":"","value":["fetchling","humanoid","shadow"]}},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.pfs-season-3-bestiary.xYByANF8t6zhxt4p"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"LRu9rZ2D08Nr5Wa4","data":{"ability":{"value":"cha"},"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"displayLevel":{},"displayLevels":{},"item":{"value":0},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":true},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":false},"signatureSpells":{"value":[]},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot1":{"max":1,"prepared":[],"value":1},"slot10":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot11":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot2":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot3":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot4":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot5":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot6":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot7":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot8":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot9":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0}},"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"spelldc":{"dc":18,"item":0,"mod":0,"value":10},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":[]},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/mystery-man.svg","name":"Occult Innate Spells","sort":100000,"type":"spellcastingEntry"},{"_id":"TNfduKabCjNGvHGp","data":{"ability":{"value":""},"area":{"areaType":"","value":null},"areasize":{"value":""},"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"category":{"value":"spell"},"components":{"focus":false,"material":false,"somatic":true,"verbal":true},"cost":{"value":""},"damage":{"value":{}},"description":{"value":"<p>You create an illusion that causes you to appear as another creature of the same body shape, and with roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and weight (within 50 pounds), as yourself.
