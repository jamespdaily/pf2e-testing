Its eyes on either side of its head-jaw are small but keen. Bony ridges protect its eyes from the frantic flailing of its prey, as it prefers meals of raw and writhing meat over fungi and molds. It grips said prey with powerful arms that split at the elbow into a pair of forearms, giving it four clawed paws.

Gugs lair far underground, but they sometimes come to the surface to hunt during dark nights, either alone or in small groups. As they possess voracious appetites, most gugs consume the creatures they catch, but some instead kidnap their victims and retreat below the surface, leaving only a lingering stench and odd, clawed paw-prints. Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked with strange runes and sacrificed to the gugs' wicked gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares. Dire rumors tell of lightless gug cities made of titanic blocks of stone far underground, where powerful gug leaders preach their vile doctrines to mobs of howling gugs.</p>\n<p>Gugs have a strange relationship with ghouls, which seems to date from their shared origin in a distant subterranean world.

These monsters are known as savants, are never less than 12th level in power, and gain several occult innate spells.

While some versions of this ritual offer all of the forms, others include only a single form or only a few of them. Whichever form you use, the effect can't be counteracted, though it can be ended by <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.4ddJSjC9Zz5DX0oG]{Freedom}</em>. Some forms of <em>imprisonment</em> can be ended by other means. Because the ritual requires the target to remain within 10 feet at all times, it typically requires you to subdue the target first.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chains</strong> You bind the creature with chains, rendering it unable to use any actions other than to speak. Other creatures that attempt to approach, harm the chains, or free the trapped creature in any way must succeed at a Will save or be unable to do so forever. The chains have Hardness equal to 5 Ã— the <em>imprisonment</em> ritual's spell level, and double that many Hit Points. Destroying the chains frees the target.</li>\n<li><strong>Object (9th level or higher)</strong> You either shrink the creature to an inch in height or transform it into an insubstantial form whose body trails away into wisps below its head. Either way, you trap it inside a gem, jar, bottle, lamp, or similar container. The creature ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. The creature is still aware of its surroundings and can move within the container and speak, but it can't use any other actions. Destroying the container kills the target rather than freeing it. This form of <em>imprisonment</em> is also transmutation magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Oubliette (10th level only)</strong> You entomb the target in a state of suspended animation deep beneath the surface of the ground and out of tune with reality so that it can't be reached by any means. You also prevent divinations from revealing the location where the <em>imprisonment</em> occurred. Powerful magic such as <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.6dDtGIUerazSHIOu]{Wish}</em> can reveal the location of the imprisonment, but even such magic can't free the target from the oubliette; only a 10th-level <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.4ddJSjC9Zz5DX0oG]{Freedom}</em> ritual can do so.</li>\n<li><strong>Prison</strong> You render the creature completely unable to leave a particular confined area or structure of your choice, such as a jail cell or sealed cave. The magic also prevents the creature from damaging its prison, either directly or indirectly, to break free. If the creature's prison is entirely destroyed by some external force, the creature is freed, though for some larger or natural prisons, this might be unfeasible.</li>\n<li><strong>Slumber (sleep effect)</strong> You put the creature into an eternal sleep. It ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. A single sincere physical display of affection from a creature who genuinely loves the target-whether romantically, filially, or otherwise-frees it from the slumber. This form of <em>imprisonment</em> is also enchantment magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Temporal Stasis</strong> You send the creature into a state of suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creature doesn't grow older and can't be affected by any effect from within the normal timestream. While casting this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends. Unlike other forms of <em>imprisonment</em>, temporal stasis can be counteracted by a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.9HpwDN4MYQJnW0LG]{Dispel Magic}</em> or <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.o6YCGx4lycsYpww4]{Haste}</em> spell.

This gives it the minion trait, meaning it can use 2 actions when you command it, and commanding it is a single action that has the auditory and concentrate traits. You can have a maximum of four minions under your control. If it's intelligent and doesn't become a minion, the undead is helpful to you for awakening it, though it's still a horrid and evil creature. If it's unintelligent and doesn't become a minion, you can give it one simple command. It pursues that goal single-mindedly, ignoring any of your subsequent commands.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, except an intelligent undead that doesn't become your minion is only friendly to you, and an unintelligent undead that doesn't become your minion leaves you alone unless you attack it.

As years pass, the lich's body crumbles to dust, leaving only the skull as the seat of its necromantic power. The lich enters a sort of torpor, its mind left wandering the planes in search of ever greater mysteries. The lich gradually loses the ability to cast spells and its magic items slowly subsume into its new form. Negative energy concentrates around the skull, causing some of its bones and teeth to petrify with power and turn into blight crystals. The resulting lich skull, embedded with arcane gemstones and suffused with palpably powerful magic, forms a creature called a demilich.</p>\n<p>Despite its near-constant state of inactivity, a demilich grows restless from time to time, especially when living creatures draw near. Only then does the demilich's hunger for life stir once more, causing it to lash out with terrifying bursts of power in attempts to consume vital energy. Unlike an ordinary lich, should the demilich's skull be destroyed, its bond to the world is permanently severed, although some theorize that even then it is not truly slain. Rather, some think that once the demilich is destroyed, its foul and tormented mind is finally free to wander the planes and find new ways to enact its will. For the short-lived common folk of the Material Plane, this is good enough, though eons later a demilich may reappear in the region it once inhabited with a newâ€”and even more insidiousâ€”agenda.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To gain more time to complete their goals, some desperate spellcasters pursue immortality by embracing undeath. After long years of research and the creation of a special container called a phylactery, a spellcaster takes the final step by imbibing a deadly concoction or casting dreadful incantations that transform them into a lich. While most undertake this drastic plan to continue their work or fulfill some long-term plan, others become liches because they fear death or to fulfill some malevolent purpose, such as long-sworn revenge. Regardless, the result is permanent and carries with it the potential to alter historyâ€”both that of those who transform themselves and of the countless mortals that will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich's new power.</p>\n<p>After its metamorphosis, a lich often finds some quiet place to dwell, typically protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane, further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich's servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a lich's lair is a good indicator of the undead's current mental state.</p>\n<p>For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to guard its phylactery, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difficult to bargain with, though the threat of damaging its phylactery is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #149: Against the Scarlet Triad"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":29},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":32},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":35}},"traits":{"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":["disease","paralyzed","polymorph","poison","unconscious"]},"dr":[{"exceptions":"","label":"Cold","type":"cold","value":"10"},{"exceptions":"","label":"Electricity","type":"electricity","value":"10"},{"exceptions":"","label":"Fire","type":"fire","value":"10"},{"exceptions":"except bludgeoning","label":"Physical","type":"physical","value":"10"}],"dv":[],"languages":{"custom":"Ancient Osiriani","selected":[],"value":["abyssal","daemonic","draconic","elven","infernal","necril"]},"rarity":{"value":"unique"},"senses":{"value":"darkvision, true seeing"},"size":{"value":"tiny"},"traits":{"custom":"","value":["undead"]}},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.age-of-ashes-bestiary.X7zSx8LFh2ZDnOYy"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"lup461lEK9zazSYF","data":{"ability":{"value":"cha"},"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"displayLevels":{},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":true},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":true},"signatureSpells":{"value":[]},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot1":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot10":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot11":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot2":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot3":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot4":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot5":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot6":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot7":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot8":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0},"slot9":{"max":0,"prepared":[],"value":0}},"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"spelldc":{"dc":43,"mod":0,"value":37},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":[]},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":100000,"type":"spellcastingEntry"},{"_id":"WCo48u5xkEJam1VM","data":{"ability":{"value":""},"area":{"areaType":"","value":""},"areasize":{"value":"40-foot emanation"},"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"category":{"value":"spell"},"components":{"focus":false,"material":false,"somatic":true,"verbal":true},"cost":{"value":""},"damage":{"value":{"0":{"type":{"categories":[],"value":"negative"},"value":"8d10"}}},"description":{"value":"<p>Your scream chills the souls of enemies that hear it.

You can also leave out this step, removing the need for a Crafting check, with the same result (if you're summoning a good extraplanar creature you trust, for example).

Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage.

That was long ago, however, and emperor birds eventually fell out of fashion. Inevitably their former owners forgot about their colorful pets, and hundreds of neglected emperor birds were released back into the wild by weary servants. While many such freed birds perished quickly in the unfamiliar woodlands of Avistan, some managed to hold out, and emperor birds can still be encountered in the Verduran Forest.</p>\n<p>The emperor bird uses its brilliant, iridescent plumage for mating displays as well as for intimidating rival suitors and potential predators. Not only are the feathers beautiful, but they are actually magical-a fact that has piqued the interest of alchemists and wizards alike, many of whom have spent decades capturing and breeding emperor birds in the hope of unlocking their arcane secrets.

You can also leave out this step, removing the need for a Crafting check, with the same result (if you're summoning a good outsider you trust, for example).

A creature that doesn't wish to negotiate at all can attempt a Will save to stay on its home plane.

Evil extraplanar creatures are more likely to accept a bargain for a lower cost as long as it allows them to wreak havoc on the Material Plane or inflict evil upon the world along the way. Monetary prices usually range from the cost of a consumable item of the creature's level for a short and simple task to a permanent magic item of the creature's level or more to persuade the creature to fight alongside you.

These are far enough away that it's impractical for a PC to bring water back and forth. However, a PC might instruct the more steely nerved spectators to create a bucket brigade. It takes 15 spectators (which can include those rescued by councilors as well as by PCs) to set this up, and 2 rounds for the townspeople to line up and begin pumping water from Fountain Circle.
