She learns about them from her wisp allies and you can thereafter use her whenever her appearance might cause the most tension. She should attack at least once on each dungeon level, as often as every couple of days. You shouldn't have Belcorra fight alongside other creatures until the adventure's finale-she's tough enough on her own!</p>\n<p>Each time Belcorra attacks, she learns more about how the heroes fight and adapts her tactics and her preparations. She might cast spell immunity to protect herself from the heroes' most effective spells, true seeing or see invisibility to keep them in sight, or dispel magic to counter their magical defenses. She mocks the heroes for their failures and rages at their successes-remember, she has been aware of them since her test firing of Gauntlight's beam in \"Ruins of Gauntlight.\"</p>\n<p><strong>First Attack</strong>: As soon as Belcorra realizes the heroes' presence, she seeks them out, traveling through the Gauntlight footprint (areas A37 and B28). She casts phantasmal calamity at a distance and retreats, moving through walls if necessary so the heroes can't follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Second Attack</strong>: Belcorra wants the heroes to fear her, so she approaches them more closely the second time and uses single-target spells like feeblemind and phantasmal killer while demanding the heroes flee her Abomination Vaults. With her message delivered, she retreats after only a few rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Later Attacks</strong>: Once the heroes have recovered a fulcrum lens or the Fulcrum Lattice, Belcorra considers the heroes an actual threat, but her anger overrides her caution. She attacks with her full might, using her Corrupting Gaze and ghostly hand along with her spells. If she defeats a hero, she retreats, confident that they'll leave her alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Leveraging Agents</strong>: Belcorra has several living allies within the Abomination Vaults, including the urdefhan cult and the Children of Belcorra. She might send these groups after the heroes, insisting they let the heroes know they're acting on Belcorra's orders. Fortunately, neither group can muster large numbers, so the heroes should be able to manage an attack from them.</p>\n<p><strong>Killing Allies</strong>: Belcorra learns if the heroes make alliances, such as with nearby calignis or drow. She knows better than to face powerful, entrenched leaders like Galudu or Quara, but she might murder a few guards or direct monsters where they can most damage the heroes' allies. It's important to Belcorra that she leave some evidence (usually a single, injured survivor) to let the heroes know she had orchestrated the attack.</p>\n<p><strong>In the Footprint</strong>: Belcorra is most effective fighting the heroes who enter the Gauntlight footprint (areas A37 and B28) due to her Haunted Lighthouse ability.</p>\n<p><strong>The Final Attack</strong>: If the heroes defeat Belcorra shortly before they reach the Empty Vault, she uses the power of the Ebon Fulcrum Lens to hasten her rejuvenation so she can face them in her sanctum. Belcorra doesn't ever surrender or flee in the Empty Vault. The heroes could possibly face her there without yet having the ability to permanently defeat her. In this case, they'll need to retreat to collect the fulcrum lenses and return to face her again. Once the heroes can focus Nhimbaloth's gaze upon Belcorra, they can defeat the sorcerer for good.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #165: Eyes of Empty Death"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":16},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":22},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":20}},"traits":{"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":["death-effects","disease","paralyzed","poison","precision","unconscious"]},"dr":[{"exceptions":"except force, ghost touch, or positive;

You can also leave out this step, removing the need for a Crafting check, with the same result (if you're summoning a good extraplanar creature you trust, for example).

Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p>\n<p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p>\n<p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o'-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don't tire of certain flavors of fear.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Feeding not on fear but on the ephemeral potentiality of magic lodged in the minds of their victims, these will-o'-wisps are a bane to casters of all types. They usually leave non-spellcasters alone and sometimes follow adventuring groups without spellcasters on the hope of being led to creatures they find more appetizing.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #164: Hands of the Devil"}},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":16},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":14}},"traits":{"attitude":{"value":"hostile"},"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":["magic"]},"dr":[],"dv":[],"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["aklo","common"]},"rarity":{"value":"common"},"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"size":{"value":"sm"},"traits":{"custom":"","value":["aberration","air"]}},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.abomination-vaults-bestiary.NXdpFypPPmRwYBT1"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"2rAKighB6Ywhk5s3","data":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":[]},"bonus":{"value":17},"damageRolls":{"jtguda2tjozvfz78bzs3":{"damage":"2d8+4","damageType":"electricity"}},"description":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":["electricity","magical"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Shock","sort":100000,"type":"melee"},{"_id":"51r9xhJpaBdZxkK3","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"interaction"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.Darkvision]</p>"},"requirements":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":"darkvision","source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":[]},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.qCCLZhnp2HhP3Ex6"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Darkvision","sort":200000,"type":"action"},{"_id":"wChn2PEw9GYziq2n","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"defensive"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>@Template[type:emanation|distance:20]{20 Feet} @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.v61oEQaDdcRpaZ9X]{Aura}</p>\n<p>A will-o'-wisp is itself naturally invisible, but glows with a colored light, casting bright light in the aura and making it visible.</p>"},"requirements":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":["aura","light"]},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Glow","sort":300000,"type":"action"},{"_id":"3Eksrmh390T4SrP7","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"defensive"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>A will-o'-wisp is immune to all spells except <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.HRb2doyaLtaoCfi3]{Faerie Fire}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.0qaqksrGGDj74HXE]{Glitterdust}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gKKqvLohtrSJj3BM]{Magic Missile}</em>, and <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Oj1PJBMQD9vuwCv7]{Maze}</em>.</p>"},"requirements":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":[]},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Magic Immunity","sort":400000,"type":"action"},{"_id":"F8xpT7h5a5ZviXU5","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"offensive"},"actionType":{"value":"action"},"actions":{"value":1},"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Requirement</strong> A creature who can cast spells is within 15 feet of the spellvoid;</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The spellvoid feeds on the creature's magic.

It generates the appropriate sounds, smells, and feels believable to the touch. If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows.</p>\n<p>In combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the Spell. It uses your spell attack roll for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC - 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster-for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage-the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage.

Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p>\n<p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p>\n<p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o'-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don't tire of certain flavors of fear.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Aquatic will-o'-wisps, will-o'-the-deeps dwell within oceans and even terrestrial lakes, and strings of them can create profoundly beautiful vistas. Their propensity to draw ships toward reefs and whirlpools or to swarm smaller vessels makes them a deadly hazard.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #164: Hands of the Devil"}},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":16},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":14}},"traits":{"attitude":{"value":"hostile"},"ci":[],"di":{"custom":"","value":["magic"]},"dr":[],"dv":[],"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["aklo","common"]},"rarity":{"value":"common"},"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"size":{"value":"sm"},"traits":{"custom":"","value":["aberration","air","amphibious"]}},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.abomination-vaults-bestiary.YXF12ssz8tEh2YUe"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"2rAKighB6Ywhk5s3","data":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":[]},"bonus":{"value":17},"damageRolls":{"jtguda2tjozvfz78bzs3":{"damage":"2d8+4","damageType":"electricity"}},"description":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":["electricity","magical"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Shock","sort":100000,"type":"melee"},{"_id":"51r9xhJpaBdZxkK3","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"interaction"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.Darkvision]</p>"},"requirements":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":"darkvision","source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":[]},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.qCCLZhnp2HhP3Ex6"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/action.svg","name":"Darkvision","sort":200000,"type":"action"},{"_id":"wChn2PEw9GYziq2n","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"defensive"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>@Template[type:emanation|distance:20]{20 Feet} @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.v61oEQaDdcRpaZ9X]{Aura}</p>\n<p>A will-o'-wisp is itself naturally invisible, but glows with a colored light, casting bright light in the aura and making it visible.</p>"},"requirements":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":["aura","light"]},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Glow","sort":300000,"type":"action"},{"_id":"3Eksrmh390T4SrP7","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"defensive"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>A will-o'-wisp is immune to all spells except <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.HRb2doyaLtaoCfi3]{Faerie Fire}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.0qaqksrGGDj74HXE]{Glitterdust}</em>, <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gKKqvLohtrSJj3BM]{Magic Missile}</em>, and <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Oj1PJBMQD9vuwCv7]{Maze}</em>.</p>"},"requirements":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":{"value":"common"},"value":[]},"trigger":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""},"schema":{"version":0.691,"lastMigration":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Magic Immunity","sort":400000,"type":"action"},{"_id":"F8xpT7h5a5ZviXU5","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":"offensive"},"actionType":{"value":"action"},"actions":{"value":1},"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Requirement</strong> An enemy is under a fear effect or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.yZRUzMqrMmfLu0V1]{Dying} within 15 feet of the will-o'-wisp.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The will-o'wisp feeds on the creature's terror.

Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p>\n<p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p>\n<p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o'-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don't tire of certain flavors of fear.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Nearly always adherents of the grim deity Groetus, these will-o'-wisps resemble the leering skull-faced moon of their namesake.

Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p>\n<p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p>\n<p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor.
